This project, 'Testudo', is a Solana application implementing a secure wallet system where users can deposit and withdraw funds from Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). 

Each user owns a "Centurion" account that acts as their main wallet container. A Centurion can hold multiple token accounts (called "Testudos") for different SPL tokens.

The key security innovation is a dual-signature system: all fund withdrawals require both the user's wallet signature AND a signature from a special keypair derived from a memorable 6-word mnemonic phrase. This creates an on-chain 2FA experience, where the public key of this password-derived keypair is stored in the Centurion account for verification during transactions.

The system aims to balance security and usability - users can memorize their 6-word phrase instead of needing to retrieve it from secure storage each time, while still maintaining strong protection against unauthorized access. For recovery, users can optionally configure a backup owner address (called "Optio").

The program enforces that all withdrawals, token transfers, and account management operations verify both the account owner's signature and a valid signature from the mnemonic-derived keypair before executing any sensitive operations.
